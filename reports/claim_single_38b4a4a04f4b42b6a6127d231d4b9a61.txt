    • Risk Level:                                Low
    • Potential Saving:                          $4.45

    • Beneficiaries Count:                      1

Likely Fraud Types
    • No strong indicators of common fraud schemes (e.g., up‑coding,
      duplicate billing, or unnecessary service provision) are present.
    • The single beneficiary and outpatient status reduce the likelihood
      of complex fraudulent arrangements.

Patterns or Causes
    • High deductible payment (50 % of claim amount) suggests the patient
      met deductible requirements, not an attempt to inflate costs.
    • Single claim with no prior high‑risk flags in the member’s history.
    • No recent spikes in claim volume or unusual provider activity.

Recommended Actions
    • Maintain routine monitoring of this member’s claims; no immediate
      investigative action required.
    • Verify that the deductible payment aligns with the member’s
      policy terms (automatic confirmation via the insurer’s system).
    • Flag the claim in the audit trail for a quick review if future
      claims from this provider or beneficiary exhibit abnormal patterns.

Final Verdict
    • The evidence supports a **Low‑Risk** classification with a negligible
      probability of fraud (0.81 %).  
    • No additional investigative or corrective actions are warranted at
      this time.  Continue standard oversight and record the finding in
      the fraud management system for future reference.
