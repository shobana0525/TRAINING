### 1. Overall Fraud Situation
	• **Probability** of fraud is 1.28 %, well below the industry threshold for high‑risk providers.  
	• **Risk Level** is classified as *Low*, indicating that routine monitoring suffices.  
	• **Potential savings** from targeted audit flows to a nominal $0.02, reflecting minimal exposure.  
	• **Claim & Deductible** figures are equal ($2 each), suggesting a single claim that fully covered the deductible without additional adjustments.  
	• **Inpatient Status** is 1, confirming the claim pertains to an inpatient service.  
	• **Beneficiaries**: 22 individuals served under this provider’s network; no single beneficiary accounts for a disproportionate claim volume.

### 2. Likely Fraud Types
	• **Billing for an unused deductible**: The deductible amount paid matches the claim amount, an atypical pattern that may indicate a **duplicate billing** or **upcoding** attempt.  
	• **Upcoding of inpatient services**: The provider’s inpatient status coupled with a single, low‑value claim raises the possibility of **upcoding** to a higher CPT code than warranted.  
	• **Patient‑induced fraud**: With 22 beneficiaries, a **small cluster** (≤ 3) could be responsible for inflated charges if they are coerced or misinformed.  

### 3. Patterns or Causes
	• **Single‑claim concentration**: Only one claim is recorded, suggesting either a very small claim portfolio or incomplete data capture.  
	• **Symmetry of amounts**: Claim and deductible equal, which is statistically uncommon unless the service was at the threshold of coverage.  
	• **Low claim value**: $2 is below the typical inpatient charge range, possibly an error or fraud indicator (e.g., rounding or misreporting).  
	• **Beneficiary distribution**: No beneficiary accounts for more than 5 % of total claims, reducing the likelihood of a large‑scale beneficiary‑based scheme.

### 4. Recommended Actions
	1. **Verify Claim Details**  
	   – Cross‑check the CPT/ICD codes and service dates with the provider’s medical records.  
	   – Confirm that the deductible amount was correctly applied and not duplicated.  
	2. **Audit Inpatient Claims**  
	   – Conduct a focused audit of all inpatient claims from this provider, emphasizing those with low claim amounts.  
	   – Review coding sheets for potential upcoding or unbundling.  
	3. **Beneficiary Confirmation**  
	   – Validate the identity and eligibility of all 22 beneficiaries to rule out identity theft or beneficiary misrepresentation.  
	   – Ensure beneficiary consent and accurate enrollment data.  
	4. **Data Integrity Check**  
	   – Assess the data capture pipeline for potential errors (e.g., rounding, data entry mistakes).  
	   – Implement automated flagging for claims where claim amount equals deductible.  
	5. **Monitoring Plan**  
	   – Maintain a *low‑risk* monitoring status, but set up quarterly reviews to detect any emerging patterns.  

### 5. Final Verdict
The available data indicate a **low‑probability, low‑impact fraud scenario**. While the symmetry between claim and deductible amounts is atypical, it does not, in isolation, substantiate a fraud claim. The recommended verification steps will confirm whether the observed pattern is an administrative anomaly or a subtle fraud attempt. Pending the results of the audit, the provider should remain in the *Low* risk category, with continued monitoring and periodic data integrity reviews.
