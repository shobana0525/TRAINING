**2. Likely Fraud Types**  
&nbsp;&nbsp;| Fraud Category | Evidence | Likelihood | Remarks |
|-----------------|----------|------------|---------|

| **Upcoding** | Inpatient status present; no higher tier codes | Low | Upcoding not indicated. |
| **False Claims** | No supporting documentation flagged | Very Low | Insufficient data to confirm. |

&nbsp;&nbsp;• The claim is a **single inpatient service** with an amount equal to the deductible, suggesting a *straight‑forward* claim.  
&nbsp;&nbsp;• The **beneficiary count is one**, aligning with typical single‑patient encounters.  
&nbsp;&nbsp;• No **historical anomalies** (e.g., repeated high‑value claims, unusual coding patterns) are present in the dataset.  
&nbsp;&nbsp;• The **low fraud probability** may stem from consistent adherence to billing guidelines in this provider’s records.

**4. Recommended Actions**  
&nbsp;&nbsp;• **Continue Monitoring** – Maintain baseline surveillance; flag any future claims that deviate from this pattern.  
&nbsp;&nbsp;• **Data Enrichment** – Incorporate additional data points (e.g., procedure codes, provider identifiers) to refine risk scoring.  
&nbsp;&nbsp;• **Audit Sampling** – Perform a periodic audit of inpatient claims to ensure compliance, even though the risk is low.  
&nbsp;&nbsp;• **Stakeholder Communication** – Inform the provider of the low risk assessment; encourage transparent reporting of any changes in service patterns.

**5. Final Verdict**  
&nbsp;&nbsp;After reviewing the available statistics, the provider exhibits **low fraud risk** with no substantive indicators of fraudulent activity.  
&nbsp;&nbsp;The **fraud probability (1.22 %)** and **potential savings (1 %)** confirm that any impact is minimal.  
&nbsp;&nbsp;The recommended course is to **maintain standard monitoring** and **enhance data granularity** for future assessments, while acknowledging that the current claim is deemed legitimate.
