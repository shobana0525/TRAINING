---

### 2. Likely Fraud Types  
| Fraud Category | Indicators | Suggested Investigation Focus |
|----------------|------------|------------------------------|
| **Billing for Non‑Provided Services** | Deductible paid equals half the claim amount; no inpatient indication | Verify service dates and provider records |
| **Duplicate Claims** | Single beneficiary, single claim; high deductible | Check for duplicate claim IDs in the same billing period |
| **Up‑coding** | Claim amount $912 for outpatient service | Compare CPT/HCPCS codes to actual services rendered |
| **Unbundling** | Deductible paid matches typical 50 % split | Review bundled vs. unbundled service codes |

---

### 3. Patterns or Causes  
- **High Deductible vs. Total Claim** – The deductible ($456) is exactly 50 % of the claim, a pattern in certain billing schemes.  
- **Outpatient Status** – No inpatient indicator reduces complexity but may increase risk of unbundling.  
- **Single Beneficiary** – Limits the scope for beneficiary-level collusion but raises the possibility of provider‑centered fraud.

### 4. Recommended Actions  
| Action | Priority | Description |
|--------|----------|-------------|
| **Cross‑Validate Service Dates** | High | Confirm that the dates of service align with provider schedules and patient records. |
| **Audit CPT/HCPCS Codes** | High | Ensure codes match the documented services and are not higher‑level codes used to inflate reimbursement. |
| **Check for Duplicate Claims** | Medium | Search the system for identical claim numbers or identical services within a 30‑day window. |
| **Interview Provider** | Low | Obtain verbal confirmation of services rendered and clarify any discrepancies. |
| **Document Findings** | High | Prepare a detailed report to support potential future actions (e.g., claim denial, audit, or legal proceeding). |

---

### 5. Final Verdict  
- **Risk Assessment:** Low probability (0.81 %) of fraud.  
- **Action Recommendation:** Initiate a **moderate‑depth audit** focusing on billing codes, service dates, and deductible alignment.  
- **Outcome Possibility:** If discrepancies are found, potential savings of **$4.45 k** could be realized; otherwise, the claim may be processed as legitimate.
