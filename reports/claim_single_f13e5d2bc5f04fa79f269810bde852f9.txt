#### 2. Likely Fraud Types  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;1. **Up‑coding / Code Misclassification** – unlikely given outpatient status and low claim amount.  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;2. **Duplicate Billing** – no evidence of repeated claim IDs or overlapping dates.  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp> 3. **Identity Theft / Beneficiary Misrepresentation** – single beneficiary reduces risk.

#### 3. Patterns or Causes  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;• **Single Beneficiary & Outpatient** – typical of standard, low‑volume services.  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;• **Deductible Paid equals 50 % of Claim** – suggests standard co‑payment structure, no over‑billing.  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;• **Low Fraud Probability** – aligns with the absence of high‑value services or complex procedures.

#### 4. Recommended Actions  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;1. **Routine Monitoring** – continue standard audit procedures; no immediate flagging required.  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;2. **Data Validation** – confirm that the deductible amount matches the policy schedule for this claim type.  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp> 3. **Periodic Review** – include this claim in quarterly low‑risk audit samples.

#### 5. Final Verdict  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The claim demonstrates a **low probability of fraud** with a negligible potential savings impact. No evidence of fraudulent activity was identified. The claim may proceed to payment after standard verification, with no additional investigative resources required at this time.
