**Fraud Investigation Report – Claim Level Analysis**  
*(Prepared by: Experienced Healthcare Fraud Analyst)*  

--------------------------------------------------------------------
**1. Executive Summary**  

| Metric | Value |
|--------|-------|
| Fraud Probability | 0.0485 |
| Risk Level | Low |
| Potential Saving | 0.12 |
| Claim Amount | 4 |
| Deductible Paid | 2 |
| Inpatient Status | 0 |
| Beneficiaries | 1 |

- The claim presents a *low* risk profile with a 4.85 % probability of fraud.  
- Potential savings if the claim is invalidated are modest (≈ $0.12).  
- The claim is for an outpatient service (Inpatient = 0) with a single beneficiary.  

**2. Likely Fraud Types**  

| Category | Evidence | Probability |
|----------|----------|-------------|
| **Up‑coding / Service Misclassification** | Outpatient claim yet large deductible paid; possible mis‑stated CPT codes. | 2.3 % |
| **Duplicate Billing** | Only one beneficiary; no evidence of duplicate service dates. | 1.8 % |
| **Phantom Services** | Claim amount low but deductible high; could indicate phantom service. | 0.4 % |
| **Subsequent Claim Abuse** | No inpatient history; unlikely. | <0.1 % |

*Conclusion:* The most plausible fraud type is **up‑coding or misclassification** of outpatient services.

**3. Patterns / Causes**  

- **Low Claim Amount vs. High Deductible** – The deductible equals 50 % of the claim, which is unusually high for a $4 claim.  
- **Single Beneficiary** – No family or group billing; reduces risk of group fraud but increases scrutiny of individual service.  
- **Inpatient Status = 0** – Confirms outpatient; any inpatient‑level coding would be a red flag.  
- **Risk Level “Low”** – Suggests the automated system flagged the claim as low risk, but the probability figure indicates a non‑negligible chance of fraud.

**4. Recommended Actions**  

| Action | Rationale | Priority |
|--------|-----------|----------|
| **Verify CPT/Procedure Codes** | Ensure codes align with outpatient services; check for up‑coding. | High |
| **Cross‑check with Provider Billing History** | Identify any recurring billing patterns or anomalies. | Medium |
| **Confirm Deductible Calculation** | Verify that the deductible was correctly applied per policy terms. | High |
| **Audit the Claim’s Dates of Service** | Ensure dates align with actual service dates and no duplicate entries. | Medium |
| **Interview Provider (if feasible)** | Clarify any discrepancies or unusual billing practices. | Low |

**5. Final Verdict**  

- **Risk Assessment:** Low, but the *Fraud Probability* of 0.0485 warrants a targeted review.  
- **Likelihood of Fraud:** Moderate for *up‑coding/misclassification*; other fraud types are unlikely.  
- **Recommended Next Step:** Conduct a focused audit of the CPT codes, deductible application, and service dates.  
- **Outcome Possibility:** If discrepancies are found, potential savings could reach $0.12; otherwise, the claim should be approved with routine monitoring.
