    ├─ Deductible Amount Paid: $2,000

```

```
3. Patterns or Causes
    ├─ High deductible paid ($2,000) relative to claim size
    ├─ Outpatient services with a probability >10% for fraud
    ├─ Moderate beneficiary count (23) increases claim volume
    └─ Low overall risk level but non‑zero probability suggests
       possible systemic or isolated billing irregularities.
```

```
4. Recommended Actions
    ├─ Conduct a targeted audit of the 23 beneficiaries’ claims
    ├─ Verify service dates, CPT codes, and provider credentials
    ├─ Cross‑check billing with medical records for duplicate entries
    ├─ Implement a data‑driven alert rule for outpatients with
    │   deductibles >$1,500 and claim amounts >$4,000
    └─ Schedule a quarterly review of provider billing patterns
```

```
5. Final Verdict
    ├─ The fraud probability (0.1098) combined with a low risk level
    │   indicates a **low‑to‑moderate potential for fraud**.
    ├─ Potential savings of $329.36 are modest compared to the
    │   overall claim volume ($5,000).
    ├─ Immediate high‑priority action is not warranted; however,
    │   a focused audit and enhanced monitoring are recommended.
    └─ Decision: **Proceed with monitoring and targeted audit**,
       maintaining current claims processing procedures pending
       audit findings.
