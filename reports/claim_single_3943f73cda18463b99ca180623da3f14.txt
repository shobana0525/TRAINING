**1. Overall Fraud Situation**  
  The claim exhibits a *Fraud Probability* of **0.0081** (0.81 %), placing it in the **Low** risk tier.  
  Given the modest *Potential Saving* of **$4.45**, the financial impact of any fraudulent activity on this single claim is minimal.  
  However, even low‑probability claims warrant review when combined with systemic patterns.

**2. Likely Fraud Types**  
  | Potential Fraud Type | Rationale |
|-----------------------|-----------|
| **Duplicate Claim**  | Deductible paid equals half the claim amount, a common indicator of double billing. |
| **Up‑coding / Billing for Unperformed Services** | Outpatient status with a high deductible suggests possible billing for services that exceed the policy’s covered scope. |
| **Vendor or Provider Misrepresentation** | Single beneficiary and no inpatient services reduce complexity; fraud may stem from the provider’s billing practices. |

**3. Patterns or Causes**  
  - **Deductible/Claim Ratio**: The deductible paid ($456) is exactly 50 % of the total claim ($912).  
  - **Outpatient Claim**: Inpatient status is 0, limiting the scope to outpatient services where coding errors or up‑coding are more prevalent.  
  - **Single Beneficiary**: Simplifies the claim structure; fraud is likely concentrated at the provider level rather than beneficiary collusion.  
  - **Low Claim Amount**: Small monetary value reduces the perceived risk for fraudsters, yet the probability remains non‑zero.

**4. Recommended Actions**  
  1. **Verify Service Dates & Codes** – Cross‑check billed CPT/HCPCS codes against the actual services rendered and dates.  
  2. **Confirm Deductible Calculation** – Ensure the deductible amount aligns with the policy’s deductible schedule and that no duplication occurred.  
  3. **Audit Provider History** – Review the provider’s historical claims for similar patterns (e.g., 50 % deductible paid).  
  4. **Engage Beneficiary** – If feasible, obtain confirmation from the beneficiary regarding the services claimed.  
  5. **Document Findings** – Record all audit steps and outcomes for potential future reference or escalation.

**5. Final Verdict**  
  The claim falls within the **Low** risk category with a **Fraud Probability** of 0.81 %.  
  While the immediate financial exposure is minimal, the identified patterns—particularly the exact 50 % deductible/claim ratio—justify a targeted audit to rule out duplication or up‑coding.  
  Proceed with the recommended actions; if findings confirm legitimate billing, close the case with a note of “No Fraud Detected.”  
  If discrepancies are uncovered, initiate the appropriate remediation or penalty workflow per the organization’s fraud policy.
