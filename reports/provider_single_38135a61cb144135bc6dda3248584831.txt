**Fraud Investigation Report – Provider‑Level Analysis**  
*Prepared by: Senior Healthcare Fraud Analyst*  
*Date: 2025‑10‑04*  

| **Metric**                 | **Value** |
|----------------------------|-----------|
| Fraud Probability         | **0.0122** (1.22 %) |
| Risk Level                 | **Low** |
| Potential Saving           | **$0.01** |
| Claim Amount               | **$1** |
| Deductible Amount Paid     | **$1** |
| Inpatient Status           | **1** (yes) |
| Beneficiaries Count        | **1** |

### 1. Overall Fraud Situation
- The **fraud probability** of 1.22 % places this claim in the *Low* risk category.  
- The **potential saving** of only $0.01 indicates that, even if fraud were confirmed, the financial impact on the insurer would be negligible.  
- The claim represents a **single inpatient service** with a **claim amount of $1** and a **deductible of $1**, suggesting either a data entry error or a minimal‑value transaction.  

---

### 2. Likely Fraud Types
| **Type**                     | **Relevance** | **Supporting Evidence** |
|------------------------------|---------------|-------------------------|
| *Billing for Non‑Provided Care* | Low | Claim amount equals deductible, implying no net service charge. |
| *Duplicate Billing*             | Low | No evidence of prior claims in the dataset; single beneficiary. |
| *Up‑coding / Misclassification* | Low | Inpatient status present but claim amount minimal; unlikely to be up‑coded. |
| *Data Entry / System Error*     | High | Claim and deductible values identical; suggests clerical mistake. |

---

### 3. Patterns or Causes
- **Single‑Beneficiary, Single‑Claim**: The dataset shows exactly one beneficiary for one claim, pointing to a *point‑in‑time* anomaly rather than a systemic pattern.  
- **Cost Alignment**: Claim amount equals deductible amount, indicating that the insurer paid *nothing beyond the deductible*, a scenario that can arise from a *billing error* or *unverified service claim*.  
- **Inpatient Flag**: The claim is marked inpatient, yet the financial values are minimal; this mismatch can trigger a *flag* but may be a *false positive* due to data entry.  

---

### 4. Recommended Actions
| **Action**                                 | **Priority** | **Notes** |
|--------------------------------------------|--------------|-----------|
| **Verify Claim Documentation**             | High         | Obtain CPT/HCPCS codes, provider notes, and dates of service. |
| **Cross‑Check with Provider Records**      | High         | Confirm that the service was performed and billed. |
| **Audit Deductible Application**           | Medium       | Ensure deductible was correctly applied and that no co‑insurance remains. |
| **System Validation Rule Review**          | Low          | Check for automated checks that flag claims where claim amount = deductible. |
| **Follow‑up with Beneficiary**             | Low          | Clarify if beneficiary received any service. |

---

### 5. Final Verdict
Given the **low fraud probability (1.22 %)**, the **minimal potential savings ($0.01)**, and the **strong likelihood of a data entry error**, the claim is **unlikely to represent significant fraud**.  
**Action**: Conduct the recommended verification steps to confirm the claim’s validity. If documentation confirms a legitimate service, no further action is required. If evidence of a clerical or billing error is found, correct the claim record and log the incident for quality‑control purposes.
