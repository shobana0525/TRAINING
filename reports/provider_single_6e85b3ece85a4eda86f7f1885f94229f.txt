	Key Statistics
		Fraud Probability       : 0.0181
		Risk Level              : Low
		Potential Saving        : $0.02
		Claim Amount            : $2
		Deductible Paid         : $2
		Inpatient Status        : 1  (Inpatient claim)
		Beneficiaries Count     : 2

	1. Overall Fraud Situation
		- The probability of fraud for this provider’s recent claim is 1.81 %.  
		- The risk level is designated as “Low” by the predictive model.  
		- The potential saving if the claim is invalidated is only $0.02, indicating a negligible financial impact.  
		- The claim amount ($2) is identical to the deductible paid ($2), suggesting the claim covers a single, minimally priced service.  
		- The claim is for an inpatient service and involves two beneficiaries.

	2. Likely Fraud Types
		- **Duplicate Billing** – The exact match between claim amount and deductible may indicate a duplicate entry for a single service.  
		- **Up‑coding/Improper Code Utilization** – For such a small claim, any up‑coding would be easily detectable by threshold checks.  
		- **Non‑existent Service Billing** – Although the amount is low, the inpatient status raises the possibility that the service was billed without actual delivery.

	3. Patterns or Causes
		- **Minimal Claim Size** – The uniformity of claim and deductible amounts points to a simple, possibly automated billing routine.  
		- **Single‑Service Claims** – No mix of outpatient and inpatient codes, reducing complexity but also limiting cross‑check opportunities.  
		- **Beneficiary Duplication** – Two beneficiaries on a $2 inpatient claim could be a data entry error or a deliberate split to avoid thresholds.

	4. Recommended Actions
		- **Data Validation** – Verify the claim against the provider’s service records and medical charts.  
		- **Cross‑Check Beneficiaries** – Confirm that both beneficiaries were actually present for the inpatient service.  
		- **Audit History** – Review the provider’s past claims for similar patterns (small, single‑value inpatient claims).  
		- **Automated Flagging** – Enable a rule that flags any inpatient claim where the claim amount equals the deductible, regardless of size.  
		- **Periodic Review** – Schedule quarterly reviews for all low‑risk providers to catch any emerging trends.

	5. Final Verdict
		- Based on the current data, the fraud probability is low, the financial impact is negligible, and no immediate corrective action is required.  
		- Continue monitoring with the recommended safeguards, and re‑evaluate if the provider’s claim patterns change or if higher‑value claims appear.
