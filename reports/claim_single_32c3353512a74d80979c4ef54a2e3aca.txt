**1. Overall Fraud Situation**  
   • Probability of fraud: **0.81 %** – well below industry average for medical claims.  
   • Risk level: **Low** – indicates minimal likelihood of significant fraudulent activity.  
   • Potential savings from this claim: **$4.45** – negligible impact on overall loss exposure.  

**2. Likely Fraud Types**  
   | Type            | Evidence in Data | Likelihood |
   |-----------------|------------------|------------|
   | **Duplicate Billing** | Deductible paid equals 50 % of the claim; no duplicate claim ID found. | Low |
   | **Up‑coding/phantom services** | Outpatient status, single beneficiary, claim amount modest. | Low |
   | **Billing for non‑covered services** | Deductible paid at 50 % suggests partial coverage; no red flags. | Low |

**3. Patterns or Causes**  
   • **High Deductible Ratio** – 456/912 = 50 % of the claim was paid as deductible.  
      - This is typical for standard outpatient claims and does not indicate over‑billing.  
   • **Single Beneficiary & Outpatient** – Simplifies provider‑patient relationship; fewer opportunities for collusion.  
   • **Claim Amount** – $912 is within the normal range for outpatient procedures; no extreme outliers.  

**4. Recommended Actions**  
   1. **Maintain Routine Monitoring** – Add the claim to the low‑risk watch list for the next 30 days.  
   2. **Cross‑Reference Provider History** – Verify the provider’s historical claim patterns for any emerging anomalies.  
   3. **Document Findings** – Update the claim file with the risk assessment and potential savings calculation.  
   4. **No Immediate Audit Needed** – Given the low probability, skip costly manual audit unless other indicators emerge.  

**5. Final Verdict**  
   The claim presents a **low probability (0.81 %) of fraud** and a **low risk level**.  
   The potential savings of **$4.45** is minimal and does not warrant immediate intervention.  
   **Action:** Keep the claim under routine surveillance; no further investigation required at this time.
