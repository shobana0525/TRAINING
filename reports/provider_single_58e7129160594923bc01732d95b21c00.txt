🔍 KEY FINDINGS & FRAUD PATTERNS  
───────────────────────────────  
 • **Single high‑value claim** – One claim of $5,000 against a provider with only one submission makes the fraud probability appear inflated; isolated anomalies are less credible.  
 • **Low deductible relative to claim** – Deductible paid ($2,000) is 40 % of the claim, which is typical for outpatient services; no evidence of over‑billing.  
 • **High beneficiary count** – 23 beneficiaries linked to a single claim suggests a large group plan; the provider may be servicing a corporate or multi‑member plan, reducing the likelihood of individual mis‑billing.  
 • **Outpatient status** – Inpatient services are absent; outpatients generally exhibit lower fraud risk, consistent with the “Low” risk level.  
 • **Fraud probability vs. actual fraud** – The system flags ~10.98 % fraud probability, but with only one claim the statistical confidence is minimal; this aligns with the low risk assessment.  

───────────────────────────────  
🛠️ RECOMMENDED ACTIONS  
───────────────────────────────  
 • **Verify beneficiary alignment** – Cross‑check the 23 beneficiaries against the provider’s enrollment records to ensure all services were authorized.  
 • **Audit claim documentation** – Review the claim’s supporting medical records, CPT codes, and provider notes to confirm that the billed services correspond to the claimed amounts.  
 • **Monitor future claims** – Flag the provider for enhanced surveillance on the next 3–6 months, focusing on high‑value outpatient claims and any sudden increases in claim volume.  
 • **Educate the provider** – Issue a reminder about proper coding practices and the impact of high deductible payments on fraud detection thresholds.  
 • **Update risk model** – Incorporate this provider’s single‑claim data into the broader analytics to recalibrate the fraud probability for similar profiles.

✅ FINAL VERDICT  
───────────────────────────────  
 The provider exhibits a low overall fraud risk with a calculated probability of 10.98 %. Given the single, high‑value outpatient claim, the evidence does not substantiate any fraudulent activity. Continued monitoring and documentation review are recommended to maintain confidence in the provider’s compliance.
