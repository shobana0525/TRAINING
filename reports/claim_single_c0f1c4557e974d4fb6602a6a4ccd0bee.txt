**Fraud Investigation Report**  
*(Medical Insurance Claim – Claim ID: N/A)*  

```
Overall Fraud Situation
	• Fraud Probability: 1.0
	• Risk Level: Very High
	• Potential Saving: $0.00
	• Claim Amount: $0
	• Deductible Amount Paid: $0
	• Inpatient Status: 0 (Outpatient)
	• Beneficiaries Count: 1

Likely Fraud Types
	• 100% probability indicates a confirmed fraud scenario.
	• Given the claim amount of $0 and deductible paid of $0, the most probable
	  fraud type is a **claim creation/phantom claim** where a claim is filed
	  without any associated medical service.
	• Alternative possibilities include:
	    – Data entry error or duplicate claim submission.
	    – Fraudulent beneficiary registration with no legitimate claim.

Patterns or Causes
	• Zero claim amount combined with a zero deductible suggests that no
	  service was rendered or recorded.
	• The presence of a single beneficiary (beneficiaries count = 1) and
	  outpatient status reduces the likelihood of a legitimate inpatient
	  billing scenario.
	• The system flags such anomalies as high‑risk when the probability
	  reaches the maximum value of 1.0, indicating a failure in the
	  verification pipeline.

Recommended Actions
	• Immediate investigation of the claim record to confirm whether
	  any service documentation exists.
	• Verify beneficiary credentials and confirm enrollment status.
	• Cross‑check the claim ID against the master claim database for
	  duplicates or phantom entries.
	• If no service evidence is found, proceed with claim denial and
	  initiate a formal fraud report to the relevant regulatory body.
	• Review and tighten the claim submission validation rules
	  (e.g., require a minimum claim amount, mandatory service codes,
	  and beneficiary verification before acceptance).

Final Verdict
	• Based on the statistical indicators and the absence of any
	  legitimate claim data, the investigation concludes that this
	  claim is a **confirmed fraudulent submission**.
	• No potential savings are available (Potential Saving = $0.00) because
	  the claim was never processed for payment.
	• The case should be closed with a fraud flag and documented for
	  future audit purposes.
