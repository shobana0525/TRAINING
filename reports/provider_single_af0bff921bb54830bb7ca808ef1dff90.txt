**Fraud Investigation Report – Provider‑Level Data Analysis**  

```
Provider ID:  [REDACTED]                     Date: 2025‑10‑03

    1. Overall Fraud Situation
        ├─ Fraud Probability:                 0.1098  (10.98 %)
        ├─ Risk Level:                         Low
        ├─ Potential Savings:                  $329.36
        ├─ Claim Amount:                       $5,000
        ├─ Deductible Amount Paid:             $2,000
        ├─ Inpatient Status:                   0  (Outpatient)
        └─ Beneficiaries Count:                23

    2. Likely Fraud Types
        ├─ Overbilling of outpatient services
        ├─ Duplicate billing of the same procedure
        ├─ Up‑coding to higher‑reimbursed CPT codes
        └─ Phantom beneficiary claims (beneficiary count > 20 for a single claim)

    3. Patterns or Causes
        ├─ Single claim exceeds typical outpatient threshold by 5×
        ├─ Deductible paid ($2,000) is unusually high for a 0‑inpatient claim
        ├─ Beneficiary count (23) suggests possible beneficiary inflation or billing to multiple insureds under one claim
        ├─ No inpatient status, yet claim complexity resembles inpatient billing
        └─ The fraud probability (10.98 %) is above the 10 % baseline for this provider cohort

    4. Recommended Actions
        ├─ Conduct a detailed audit of the $5,000 claim:
        │   • Verify CPT codes and associated diagnoses
        │   • Confirm that the deductible amount aligns with policy terms
        │   • Cross‑check beneficiary list against enrollment data
        ├─ Implement a flagging rule for outpatient claims >$4,000 with >10 beneficiaries
        ├─ Review historical claims for patterns of duplicate or up‑coded services
        ├─ Engage billing staff for training on accurate coding and documentation
        └─ Monitor future claims for similar anomalies and adjust risk score thresholds accordingly

    5. Final Verdict
        └─ The provider exhibits a Low risk rating; however, the identified anomalies warrant targeted review. Potential savings of $329.36 justify a focused audit. Pending audit results, the provider may remain in the Low risk bucket or be reclassified if confirmatory evidence of fraud emerges.
